# Troubleshooting

Use this page to quickly isolate common runtime and integration failures.

## Audience Guidance

- Operators: start with health + logs + model inventory checks.
- Integrators: verify request auth, model name, and endpoint shape first.

## Fast Triage Checklist

```bash
# 1) Is process healthy?
curl -sS http://localhost:8317/health

# 2) Is API key auth configured correctly?
curl -sS http://localhost:8317/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-client-key>"

# 3) What models are actually exposed?
curl -sS http://localhost:8317/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-client-key>" | jq '.data[].id' | head

# 4) Any provider-side stress?
curl -sS http://localhost:8317/v1/metrics/providers | jq
```

## Service Does Not Start

Checks:

- Config path in container/host is correct and readable.
- `config.yaml` syntax is valid.
- Port is not already used by another process.

Commands:

```bash
docker logs cliproxyapi-plusplus --tail 200
lsof -iTCP:8317 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

## `401 Unauthorized` on `/v1/*`

Checks:

- Send `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`.
- Confirm key exists in `api-keys` list in `config.yaml`.
- Remove leading/trailing spaces in key value.

## Management API Returns `404`

Likely cause:

- `remote-management.secret-key` is empty, so `/v0/management/*` routes are disabled.

Fix:

```yaml
remote-management:
  secret-key: "set-a-strong-key"
```

Then restart the service.

## `429` and Rate-Limit Cascades

Checks:

- Inspect provider metrics and logs for sustained throttling.
- Add additional credentials/provider capacity.
- Reduce concurrency or enable stronger client backoff.

## Model Not Found / Unsupported Model

Checks:

- Confirm model appears in `/v1/models` for current API key.
- Verify prefix requirements (for example `team-a/model`).
- Check alias and excluded-model rules in provider config.

## Streaming Issues (SSE/WebSocket)

Checks:

- Confirm reverse proxies do not buffer SSE.
- For `/v1/responses` websocket scenarios, verify auth headers are forwarded.
- Increase upstream/request timeout where ingress is aggressive.

## Useful Endpoints

- `GET /health`
- `GET /v1/models`
- `GET /v1/metrics/providers`
- `GET /v0/management/config` (if management enabled)
- `GET /v0/management/logs` (if management enabled)
