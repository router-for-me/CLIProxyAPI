# CPB-0176..0245 Next-70 Summary

## Scope

- Planned batch: `CPB-0176` through `CPB-0245` (70 items).
- Status: documented, no implementation yet in this pass.

## Artifacts and Inputs
- Source board: `docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
- Execution board: `docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`

## Process
1. Generate task batches by CPB ID range.
2. Create per-lane plan reports (10 items each).
3. Execute items sequentially only when implementation-ready evidence is available.

## Next Step
Begin lane-1 execution first (CPB-0176 to CPB-0185) in the assigned worktree path.
