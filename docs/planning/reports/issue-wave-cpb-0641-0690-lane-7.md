## Scope
- Lane: lane-7
- Worktree: `/Users/kooshapari/temp-PRODVERCEL/485/kush/cliproxyapi-plusplus`
- Window: `CPB-0671` to `CPB-0675`

## Status Snapshot
- `implemented`: 0
- `planned`: 0
- `in_progress`: 5
- `blocked`: 0

## Per-Item Status

### CPB-0671 - Follow up on "amp使用时日志频繁出现下面报错" by closing compatibility gaps and preventing regressions in adjacent providers.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `responses-and-chat-compat`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/576`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0671" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0672 - Harden "Github Copilot Error" with clearer validation, safer defaults, and defensive fallbacks.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `responses-and-chat-compat`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/574`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0672" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0673 - Operationalize "Cursor support" with observability, alerting thresholds, and runbook updates.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `provider-model-registry`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/573`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0673" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0674 - Convert "Qwen CLI often stops working before finishing the task" into a provider-agnostic pattern and codify in shared translation utilities.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `responses-and-chat-compat`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/567`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0674" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0675 - Add DX polish around "gemini cli接入后，可以正常调用所属大模型；Antigravity通过OAuth成功认证接入后，无法调用所属的模型" through improved command ergonomics and faster feedback loops.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `oauth-and-authentication`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/566`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0675" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

## Evidence & Commands Run
- Pending command coverage for this planning-only wave.

## Next Actions
- Move item by item from `planned` to `implemented` only when code changes + regression evidence are available.
