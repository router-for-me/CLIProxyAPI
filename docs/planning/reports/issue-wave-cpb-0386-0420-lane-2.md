- Window: `CPB-0391` to `CPB-0395`

## Status Snapshot

- `planned`: 0
- `in_progress`: 5
- `blocked`: 0

## Per-Item Status

### CPB-0391 – Create/refresh provider quickstart derived from "OAuth issue with Qwen using Google Social Login" including setup, auth, model select, and sanity-check commands.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `docs-quickstarts`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1063`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0391" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0392 – Harden "[Feature] allow to disable auth files from UI (management)" with clearer validation, safer defaults, and defensive fallbacks.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `oauth-and-authentication`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1062`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.

  - `rg -n "CPB-0392" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0393 – Operationalize "最新版claude 2.1.9调用后，会在后台刷出大量warn；持续输出" with observability, alerting thresholds, and runbook updates.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `general-polish`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1061`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0393" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0394 – Convert "Antigravity 针对Pro账号的 Claude/GPT 模型有周限额了吗？" into a provider-agnostic pattern and codify in shared translation utilities.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `websocket-and-streaming`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1060`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0394" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0395 – Add DX polish around "OpenAI 兼容提供商 由于客户端没有兼容OpenAI接口，导致调用失败" through improved command ergonomics and faster feedback loops.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `thinking-and-reasoning`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1059`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0395" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

## Evidence & Commands Run

- `rg -n 'CPB-0391|CPB-0395' docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
- No repository code changes were performed in this lane in this pass; planning only.


## Next Actions
- Move item by item from `planned` to `implemented` only when regression tests and code updates are committed.
