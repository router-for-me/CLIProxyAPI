- `planned`: 0
- `in_progress`: 5
- `blocked`: 0

## Per-Item Status

### CPB-0266 – Port relevant thegent-managed flow implied by "Feature Request: Add "Sequential" routing strategy to optimize account quota usage" into first-class cliproxy Go CLI command(s) with interactive setup support.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `go-cli-extraction`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1304`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0266" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0267 – Add QA scenarios for "版本: v6.7.27 添加openai-compatibility的时候出现 malformed HTTP response 错误" including stream/non-stream parity and edge-case payloads.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `thinking-and-reasoning`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1301`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0267" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0268 – Refactor implementation behind "fix(logging): request and API response timestamps are inaccurate in error logs" to reduce complexity and isolate transformation boundaries.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `responses-and-chat-compat`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1299`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0268" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0269 – Ensure rollout safety for "cpaUsageMetadata leaks to Gemini API responses when using Antigravity backend" via feature flags, staged defaults, and migration notes.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `thinking-and-reasoning`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1297`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0269" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0270 – Standardize metadata and naming conventions touched by "Gemini API error: empty text content causes 'required oneof field data must have one initialized field'" across both repos.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `responses-and-chat-compat`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1293`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0270" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

## Evidence & Commands Run

- `rg -n 'CPB-0266|CPB-0270' docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
- No repository code changes were performed in this lane in this pass; planning only.

## Next Actions
- Move item by item from `planned` to `implemented` only when regression tests and code updates are committed.
