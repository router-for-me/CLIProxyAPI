## Per-Item Status

### CPB-0381 – Follow up on "配额管理中可否新增Claude OAuth认证方式号池的配额信息" by closing compatibility gaps and preventing regressions in adjacent providers.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `oauth-and-authentication`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1079`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0381" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0382 – Harden "Extended thinking model fails with "Expected thinking or redacted_thinking, but found tool_use" on multi-turn conversations" with clearer validation, safer defaults, and defensive fallbacks.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `thinking-and-reasoning`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1078`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.

  - `rg -n "CPB-0382" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0383 – Operationalize "functionDeclarations 和 googleSearch 合并到同一个 tool 对象导致 Gemini API 报错" with observability, alerting thresholds, and runbook updates.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `responses-and-chat-compat`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1077`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0383" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0384 – Convert "Antigravity: MCP 工具的数字类型 enum 值导致 INVALID_ARGUMENT 错误" into a provider-agnostic pattern and codify in shared translation utilities.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `responses-and-chat-compat`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1075`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0384" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0385 – Add DX polish around "认证文件管理可否添加一键导出所有凭证的按钮" through improved command ergonomics and faster feedback loops.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `websocket-and-streaming`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1074`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.

  - `rg -n "CPB-0385" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

## Evidence & Commands Run

- `rg -n 'CPB-0381|CPB-0385' docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
- No repository code changes were performed in this lane in this pass; planning only.


## Next Actions
- Move item by item from `planned` to `implemented` only when regression tests and code updates are committed.
