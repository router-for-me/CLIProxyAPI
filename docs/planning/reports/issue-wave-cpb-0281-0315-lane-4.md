- Window: `CPB-0296` to `CPB-0300`

## Status Snapshot

- `implemented`: 0
- `planned`: 0
- `in_progress`: 5
- `blocked`: 0

## Per-Item Status

### CPB-0296 – Expand docs and examples for "kiro hope" with copy-paste quickstart and troubleshooting section.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `oauth-and-authentication`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1252`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0296" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0297 – Add QA scenarios for ""Requested entity was not found" for all antigravity models" including stream/non-stream parity and edge-case payloads.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `thinking-and-reasoning`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1251`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0297" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0298 – Refactor implementation behind "[BUG] Why does it repeat twice? 为什么他重复了两次？" to reduce complexity and isolate transformation boundaries.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `provider-model-registry`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1247`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0298" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0299 – Define non-subprocess integration path related to "6.6.109之前的版本都可以开启iflow的deepseek3.2，qwen3-max-preview思考，6.7.xx就不能了" (Go bindings surface + HTTP fallback contract + version negotiation).
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `integration-api-bindings`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1245`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0299" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0300 – Standardize metadata and naming conventions touched by "Bug: Anthropic API 400 Error - Missing 'thinking' block before 'tool_use'" across both repos.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `thinking-and-reasoning`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1244`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0300" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

## Evidence & Commands Run

- `rg -n 'CPB-0296|CPB-0300' docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
- No repository code changes were performed in this lane in this pass; planning only.


## Next Actions
- Move item by item from `planned` to `implemented` only when regression tests and code updates are committed.
