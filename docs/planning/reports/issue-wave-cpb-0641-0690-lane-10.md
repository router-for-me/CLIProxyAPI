## Scope
- Lane: lane-10
- Worktree: `/Users/kooshapari/temp-PRODVERCEL/485/kush/cliproxyapi-plusplus`
- Window: `CPB-0686` to `CPB-0690`

## Status Snapshot
- `implemented`: 0
- `planned`: 0
- `in_progress`: 5
- `blocked`: 0

## Per-Item Status

### CPB-0686 - Expand docs and examples for "The token file was not generated." with copy-paste quickstart and troubleshooting section.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `thinking-and-reasoning`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/544`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0686" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0687 - Add QA scenarios for "Suggestion: Retain statistics after each update." including stream/non-stream parity and edge-case payloads.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `provider-model-registry`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/541`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0687" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0688 - Refactor implementation behind "Bug: Codex→Claude SSE content_block.index collisions break Claude clients" to reduce complexity and isolate transformation boundaries.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `thinking-and-reasoning`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/539`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0688" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0689 - Ensure rollout safety for "[Feature Request] Add logs rotation" via feature flags, staged defaults, and migration notes.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `general-polish`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/535`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0689" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0690 - Define non-subprocess integration path related to "[Bug] AI Studio 渠道流式响应 JSON 格式异常导致客户端解析失败" (Go bindings surface + HTTP fallback contract + version negotiation).
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `integration-api-bindings`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/534`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0690" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

## Evidence & Commands Run
- Pending command coverage for this planning-only wave.

## Next Actions
- Move item by item from `planned` to `implemented` only when code changes + regression evidence are available.
