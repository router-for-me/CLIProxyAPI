- `planned`: 0
- `in_progress`: 5
- `blocked`: 0

## Per-Item Status

### CPB-0441 – Follow up on "gemini 3 missing field" by closing compatibility gaps and preventing regressions in adjacent providers.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `provider-model-registry`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1002`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0441" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0442 – Create/refresh provider quickstart derived from "[Bug] Codex Responses API: item_reference in `input` not cleaned, causing 404 errors and incorrect client suspension" including setup, auth, model select, and sanity-check commands.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `docs-quickstarts`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/999`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0442" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0443 – Operationalize "[Bug] Codex Responses API: `input` 中的 item_reference 未清理，导致 404 错误和客户端被误暂停" with observability, alerting thresholds, and runbook updates.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `responses-and-chat-compat`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/998`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0443" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0444 – Convert "【建议】保留Gemini格式请求的思考签名" into a provider-agnostic pattern and codify in shared translation utilities.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `responses-and-chat-compat`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/997`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0444" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0445 – Add DX polish around "Gemini CLI 认证api，不支持gemini 3" through improved command ergonomics and faster feedback loops.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `websocket-and-streaming`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/996`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0445" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

## Evidence & Commands Run

- `rg -n 'CPB-0441|CPB-0445' docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
- No repository code changes were performed in this lane in this pass; planning only.

## Next Actions
- Move item by item from `planned` to `implemented` only when regression tests and code updates are committed.
