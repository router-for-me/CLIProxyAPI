- `planned`: 0
- `in_progress`: 5
- `blocked`: 0

## Per-Item Status

### CPB-0601 - Follow up on "怎么加入多个反重力账号？" by closing compatibility gaps and preventing regressions in adjacent providers.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `general-polish`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/723`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0601" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0602 - Harden "最新的版本无法构建成镜像" with clearer validation, safer defaults, and defensive fallbacks.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `oauth-and-authentication`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/721`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0602" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0603 - Operationalize "API Error: 400" with observability, alerting thresholds, and runbook updates.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `responses-and-chat-compat`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/719`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0603" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0604 - Convert "是否可以支持/openai/v1/responses端点" into a provider-agnostic pattern and codify in shared translation utilities.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `responses-and-chat-compat`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/718`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0604" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0605 - Add DX polish around "证书是否可以停用而非删除" through improved command ergonomics and faster feedback loops.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `general-polish`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/717`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0605" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking` (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

## Evidence & Commands Run
- Pending command coverage for this planning-only wave.

## Next Actions
- Move item by item from `planned` to `implemented` only when code changes + regression evidence are available.
