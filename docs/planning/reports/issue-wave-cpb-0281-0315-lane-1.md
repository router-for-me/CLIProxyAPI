- `planned`: 0
- `in_progress`: 5
- `blocked`: 0

## Per-Item Status

### CPB-0281 – Follow up on "TPM/RPM过载，但是等待半小时后依旧不行" by closing compatibility gaps and preventing regressions in adjacent providers.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `websocket-and-streaming`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1278`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0281" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0282 – Harden "支持codex的 /personality" with clearer validation, safer defaults, and defensive fallbacks.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `provider-model-registry`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1273`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0282" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0283 – Operationalize "Antigravity 可用模型数为 0" with observability, alerting thresholds, and runbook updates.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `websocket-and-streaming`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1270`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0283" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0284 – Convert "Tool Error on Antigravity Gemini 3 Flash" into a provider-agnostic pattern and codify in shared translation utilities.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `provider-model-registry`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1269`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0284" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

### CPB-0285 – Port relevant thegent-managed flow implied by "[Improvement] Persist Management UI assets in a dedicated volume" into first-class cliproxy Go CLI command(s) with interactive setup support.
- Status: `in_progress`
- Theme: `go-cli-extraction`
- Source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/1268`
- Rationale:
  - Item remains `proposed` in the 1000-item execution board.
  - Requires implementation-ready acceptance criteria and target-path verification before execution.
- Proposed verification commands:
  - `rg -n "CPB-0285" docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
  - `go test ./pkg/llmproxy/api ./pkg/llmproxy/thinking`  (if implementation touches those surfaces)
- Next action: add reproducible payload/regression case, then implement in assigned workstream.

## Evidence & Commands Run

- `rg -n 'CPB-0281|CPB-0285' docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_1000_ITEM_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv docs/planning/CLIPROXYAPI_2000_ITEM_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-02-22.csv`
- No repository code changes were performed in this lane in this pass; planning only.


## Next Actions
- Move item by item from `planned` to `implemented` only when regression tests and code updates are committed.
